# python-unittest-for-jenkinjob
This is simple python program with a unit test, I want to use this to make a jenkins job 

This is the link to my program which is very self explanatory, the jenkinsfile contains the required jenkins file code for deploying th pipeline and the dockerfile code for the dockerfile, the jenkinsfile needs to be added to the jenkins server code (will be updated later).

The python file runs unit tests top connect to the webserver to check weather the server is running or not and to ping the server and check if it gives code 2xx.
